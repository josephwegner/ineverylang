    description: |
      A <a href="/fibonacci-sequence">Fibonacci Sequence</a> is a list of numbers, where each number is calculated by adding up the two numbers previous to it. Most Fibonacci Sequence challenges ask the program to return the number at the Nth position in a Fibonacci sequence.

    prettyName: 'Binary Search'
    description: |
      A <a href="/binary-search">Binary Search</a> algorithm is used for searching for a value in an array. The most basic search algorithm, a Linear Search, is O(n) in complexity - the binary search improves on this at O(log n). A binary search works be breaking your search array in half continuously until you find a matching value.
